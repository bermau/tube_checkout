#Tube Checkout
Tube checkout is a project to develop open source tube handling capabilities for OpenTrons robots. An early version was developed with a passive tool to pick up tubes. You can find [version 1](https://github.com/theosanderson/tube_checkout/tree/v1) in the v1 branch of the repo, but the main repo is currently aimed at building [version 2](https://twitter.com/theosanderson/status/1286798512483708937) with active gripping.

This repo will be filled out in the coming weeks.
