# Required materials

## Tube mover
- OT2 robot
- 3D printer and filament (we used PLA)
- 3x M3 nuts
- Optional 20x20 aluminium extrusion (e.g. OpenBuilds) - this will allow you to use a 3D printer with a smaller build area. This also requires 3 T-slot nuts and M5 low profile bolts.


## Barcode scanner (optional extra)
- [Alacrity Embedded Mini USB Fixed Mount Barcode Scanner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CXXVLSD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Tubes
This device works with [Sarstedt screwcapped 2ml microtubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/2ml-sc-mtube-cbs-gwb-st-cs1000/50809242). It is not able to open lids, but can carry capped or uncapped tubes.

## Cost
This system costs significantly less than $100 including all components (excluding the OT2 robot!).
