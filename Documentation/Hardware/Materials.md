# Required materials

## Pre-requirements
- OpenTrons OT2 robot
- This device is designed to work with [Sarstedt screwcapped 2ml microtubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/2ml-sc-mtube-cbs-gwb-st-cs1000/50809242). It is not able to open lids, but can carry capped or uncapped tubes.

## Tube mover
- 3D printer and filament (we used PLA)
- - Print the [all printed grabber](https://github.com/theosanderson/TubeCheckout/blob/master/SCAD/all_printed_grabber.stl) (if this is too large for your printer's build area you can print a [grabber](https://github.com/theosanderson/TubeCheckout/blob/master/SCAD/ot_grabber_big.stl) and [mount](https://github.com/theosanderson/TubeCheckout/blob/master/SCAD/mount_2020_as_pipette.stl) separately and join them with 20x20 extrusion, T nuts, and low profile M5 bolts, but this is not recommended).
- 3x M3 nuts to help mount the grabber to the mount.

## Tube racks
- You will need one or many [custom 24 2ml tube racks](bla).

## Barcode scanner (optional extra)
- [Alacrity Embedded Mini USB Fixed Mount Barcode Scanner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CXXVLSD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- 3D printed:
- - [Barcode scanner mount for OpenTrons rack](https://github.com/theosanderson/TubeCheckout/blob/master/SCAD/barcode_plate.stl)
- - Either M2 nuts and bolts for mounting, or just tape the scanner on.



## Cost
This system costs significantly less than $100 including all components (excluding the OT2 robot!).
