The gripper could be used on its own for:
- scanning barcodes (barcodes would have to be facing the right orientation)
- moving tubes around (e.g. dipping in a waterbath/heatblock for transformation)
- stacking / unstacking specially designed labware

In concert with the delidder the gripper can be used to open tubes.
